# triangular-seed
Base Angular Project (MEAN + LESS + Bower + Gulp) that covers a bit more my needs than angular-seed

To install dependencies and get the base app running just do:
```
npm install
npm start
```

If it doesn't work maybe you need nodemon, bower and gulp instaleld and in your system's PATH:
```
npm install -g nodemon bower gulp
```
